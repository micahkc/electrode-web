# electrode web

`electrode_web` is CogniPilot's browser-based ground station and viewer for
Synapse/Zenoh systems. The same SvelteKit build runs as a static GitHub Pages
viewer and as the UI served by the local Rust ground-station daemon.

- Static Viewer: <https://cognipilot.github.io/electrode_web/>
- Developer Book: <https://cognipilot.github.io/electrode_web/dev-book/>
- Local Ground Station: <http://127.0.0.1:8790/> after `npm run ground-station`

## What It Does

- Connects directly from the browser to Zenoh over WebSocket with
  `@cognipilot/zenoh-wasm`.
- Discovers and subscribes to Synapse topics, decodes known FlatBuffer payloads,
  and adapts them into a live vehicle state.
- Provides status, map/scene, RC/manual-control, simulation, topic discovery,
  plotting, command, event, MCAP log recording, and replay views.
- Serves as a static viewer when no local backend is present.
- Unlocks host hardware workflows when served by `electrode-ground-station`,
  including joystick discovery, RC mapping, PPM bridge control, simulation
  control, and autopilot profile management.
- Includes native Rust tools for ground-station serving, manual-control input,
  PPM output, RDD2 telemetry-radio decoding, fake simulation, and
  bridge-compatible testing.

## Development Environment

Use either your host tools or the Nix development shell.

```bash
nix develop
npm ci
npm run ci
```

The CI workflow uses the same flake with Determinate Nix and FlakeHub Cache, so
local `nix develop` and GitHub Actions resolve the same toolchain baseline.

Without Nix, install Node.js 24, Rust with `rustfmt` and `clippy`, and the Linux
`libudev` development package if building serial/joystick crates. The
FlatBuffers compiler is not required for normal development or CI; Synapse
schemas are consumed from the published `@cognipilot/synapse-fbs` and
`synapse_fbs` packages, with pregenerated TypeScript/schema assets committed in
this repo.

## Web Viewer

Run the static web app in development:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite URL printed by the command. In viewer mode the app is display-only
unless it can reach a Zenoh WebSocket endpoint. Static hosting does not expose
local `gcs/*` hardware APIs.

Build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
npm run verify:pages
```

The GitHub Actions workflow publishes `apps/web/build` to GitHub Pages on pushes
to `main`.

Recordings download as `.mcap` files using FlatBuffer schema records. Replay
loads MCAP recordings.

## Local Ground Station

Build the web app and start the local daemon:

```bash
npm run build
npm run ground-station
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8790/>. The daemon serves the same static app and answers
same-origin `gcs/*` requests for host capabilities. Add `?viewer` to force
display-only mode even when the daemon is present.

The daemon separates the trusted local UI, untrusted LAN requests, LAN
telemetry, and the co-located outer-loop autopilot:

```text
local GCS website ── ws/127.0.0.1:7447 ── trusted command mapping ─┐
LAN request site  ── ws/0.0.0.0:7448 ──── checked command policy ─┤
Qualisys router   ── UDP LAN client ────── validated telemetry ───┤
                                                                  ▼
                                              udp/127.0.0.1:7447 router
                                                                  │
                                                                  ▼
                                                    local outer-loop autopilot
```

Both trusted listeners are required to use loopback locators and multicast
scouting is disabled. The station script connects only the telemetry session to
the Qualisys LAN router. It validates and allowlists `synapse/mocap/frame`,
rigid-body names, and external odometry. Local UI parameter values bypass LAN
policy; LAN request values must pass it. The autopilot never joins the LAN.

The standalone website-delivery console connects to the checked listener, not
the trusted local listener. Set its endpoint before `zenoh-direct.js` loads:

```html
<script>window.ZENOH_WS_ENDPOINT = `ws/${window.location.hostname}:7448`;</script>
```

Velocity intents from that console carry a team-name envelope. Electrode keeps
the five-command team allowance in `data/velocity-budget.csv` and publishes a
JSON inspection mirror at `data/velocity-budget-db.json`. Override those paths
with `ELECTRODE_GCS_VELOCITY_BUDGET_CSV` and
`ELECTRODE_GCS_VELOCITY_BUDGET_DB`.

## Zenoh Connection

Browsers can only use Zenoh over WebSocket. Use `ws/127.0.0.1:7447` in the app,
or point it at another router/listener that exposes `ws/`.

For a standalone LAN telemetry/router surface (never use this as the local
autopilot's command endpoint):

```bash
zenohd -l udp/0.0.0.0:7447 -l ws/0.0.0.0:7447
```

Native tools in this repo default to UDP on port 7447. Override the locator with
the relevant environment variable or CLI flag when needed.

## Simulation And Hardware

Run the fake Synapse publisher when you want a live vehicle stream without
hardware:

```bash
npm run sim:fake
```

Run the manual-control bridge for a Linux joystick/gamepad:

```bash
npm run manual:bridge -- --device /dev/input/js0
```

Inspect the manual-control stream:

```bash
npm run manual:dump -- --topic manual
```

Run the PPM bridge for hardware-in-the-loop receiver output:

```bash
npm run ppm:bridge -- \
  --manual-topic manual \
  --control-output-topic pwm \
  --serial-device /dev/ttyACM0
```

## Quality Gates

JavaScript and Rust checks are wired into CI:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:rust-files
npm run test
npm run check
npm run build
npm run verify:pages

cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```

`npm run ci` runs the JavaScript lint, unit tests, type/Svelte checks, static
build, and Pages artifact verification.

Rust crates opt into workspace lints with `clippy.toml` thresholds for nesting,
function length, argument count, and type complexity. The Rust file length check
enforces the same 2000-line tracked-source limit used by the CI lint step.

## Developer Book

The developer notes in `docs/` build into a versioned mdBook site through the
Rust `xtask` driver:

```bash
cargo install mdbook --version "$(awk -F= '/^MDBOOK_VERSION=/{print $2}' tools.lock)" --locked
cargo run --locked --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml -- docs --version main --out-dir target/xtask/docs
```

Open `target/xtask/docs/main/index.html` for a local copy. GitHub Actions also
builds the book into `apps/web/build/dev-book` during the normal Pages build, so
pushes to `main` deploy the app and the developer book together at
`https://cognipilot.github.io/electrode_web/dev-book/`.

## Notes

- `@cognipilot/zenoh-wasm` is pinned from npm, not vendored from this repo.
- The current static build uses relative asset paths so one artifact works both
  at the GitHub Pages subpath and at the local daemon root.
- Hardware access remains daemon/native-tool responsibility; browser code only
  uses same-origin `gcs/*` APIs or Zenoh WebSocket transport.
